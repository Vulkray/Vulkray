Contributor Guidelines
======================

**The instructions below have all the information you need before sending in your first pull request.**

- Before starting to work on your contribution, if you want to implement a new feature or fix an issue that has not been posted as an issue yet, please create a new issue with the information and description as needed.
- To setup your environment, fork `this repository`_, clone it to your local machine, and create a new branch for your contribution.
- For every commit created in your branch, please include this format in the message:
    - `<genre/component>: <summary>` Note: If your commit fixes/resolves an issue, please tag the issue in the message.
    - E.g. "bug fix: Handle exception for foo bar, resolves issue #123"
- Once you're ready to open a pull request, please check that you are submitting to merge your own branch from your fork.

Tracking your issues/PRs using the Project Board
````````````````````````````````````````````````

**All issues and pull requests are organized and kept track of in the project board.**

To access the project board, click on the 'Projects' tab at the top navigation bar of the repository page, or `click this link`_ to get there.

- When an issue or pull request is submitted to the repository, it is automatically sent to the project board backlog.
- If the item is a PR, and it has been reviewed or needs to be merged by a maintainer, it will be switched to 'Approved' status.
- If the item is an issue, it will be set as 'Approved' status when a maintainer finds priority for the issue.
- If a contributor wants to be assigned to an issue (or assigns themselves to the issue if they submitted it for their own contribution), the issue will be assigned to the contributor and it will be moved to 'Assigned' status on the project board.
- All closed/resolved issues and merged PRs will automatically be moved to 'Resolved' status on the project board.
